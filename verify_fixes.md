# Expression Parsing Fixes Verification

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Regex Pattern in Expression Parsing
**Problem**: The regex pattern `(\s*[\+\-\×\÷]\s*)` had incorrect character class escaping.
**Fix**: Changed to `(\s*[+\-×÷]\s*)` - removed unnecessary escaping of `+` inside character class.

### 2. Meter Unit Detection
**Problem**: The pattern `input.includes('m')` would incorrectly match "6mm" as meters.
**Fix**: Changed to `input.endsWith('m') && !input.includes('mm') && !input.includes('cm')` to properly detect meter units.

### 3. Mixed Number Parsing
**Problem**: Input like "2 1/2" was incorrectly parsed as 2 feet 1 inch (25 inches) instead of 2.5 inches.
**Fix**: Modified space-separated parsing logic to only treat as feet/inches if the second part doesn't contain a fraction slash.

### 4. Zero Result Handling
**Problem**: Valid expressions that evaluated to exactly 0 would show "Enter complete expression..." instead of the result.
**Fix**: Removed the `partialResult !== 0` condition and show the result for all valid expressions.

### 5. Error Handling for Metric Parsing
**Problem**: Invalid metric inputs could cause parsing errors.
**Fix**: Added NaN checks after parseFloat operations for all metric units.

## Test Cases That Should Now Work

1. `"5.2 + 6mm - 2 1/2"` 
   - 5.2 inches + 0.236 inches - 2.5 inches = 2.936 inches

2. `"4 3 3/32 + 48.652 - 32.6cm + 4' 5/16 - 4 2/3 - 32mm + 5.5m"`
   - Complex expression with mixed units and formats

3. `"12 + 6"`
   - Simple addition

4. `"4'6" + 12""`
   - Feet/inches notation with quoted inches

5. `"100mm + 4""`
   - Metric + inches

## Key Improvements

- **Better Unit Detection**: More precise patterns for detecting different unit types
- **Robust Mixed Number Parsing**: Correctly distinguishes between mixed numbers and feet/inches format
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better validation and null/NaN handling
- **Consistent Results**: All valid expressions show results, including zero values
