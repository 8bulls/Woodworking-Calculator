# Woodworking Calculator - Debug Session Notes
Date: 2025-08-14

## Session Summary
Fixed expression parser and mobile keyboard issues in the woodworking calculator.

## Changes Made

### 1. Expression Parser Fixes
- Fixed handling of partial expressions (e.g., "5 +")
- Fixed parseInchesWithFraction returning 0 instead of null on failure
- Added better error handling for incomplete expressions
- Improved token parsing to handle spaces correctly

### 2. Mobile Keyboard Disabled
- Added inputmode="none" to prevent native keyboard
- Made input readonly on mobile devices
- Added blur events to prevent keyboard popup
- Custom keypad still works perfectly

### 3. Keypad Redesign
- Removed equals button (real-time calculation)
- Added backspace button
- Changed ' and " to ft and in buttons
- Added m and cm buttons
- Made Space button wider (2 columns)
- Memory row only shows in Standard/Project modes

### 4. Button Styling
- White background for numbers (#ffffff)
- Orange for operations (#ff9500)
- Red for clear (#ff3b30)
- Blue for units (#007aff)
- Teal for metric (#00bfa5)
- Purple for fractions (#673ab7)

## To Test When You Return

1. Start server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. Access on mobile: `http://192.168.0.157:8000/index.html`
3. Test "5 - 1" expression
4. Verify native keyboard doesn't appear
5. Test all keypad buttons work

## Current Status
- All changes saved locally
- NOT pushed to GitHub
- Server stopped
- Ready to resume debugging when needed

## Next Steps
1. Test expression parser with various inputs
2. Verify mobile keyboard stays hidden
3. Test on actual mobile devices
4. Consider pushing to GitHub once confirmed working
